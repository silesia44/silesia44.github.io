				<div class="dark">
				<p>This is where we come from, everything we do is rooted in sport. And sport plays an increasingly important role in more and more people’s lives, on and off the field of play. Sport is central to every culture and society and is core to an individual’s health and happiness. Therefore, we believe that, through sport, we have the power to change lives. This core belief guides the way we run our company, how we work with our partners, how we create our products, and how we engage with our consumers.</p>

				<p>
					Athletes will not settle for average. And neither do we. We have a clear mission: To be the best sports company in the world. Every day, we come to work to create and sell the best sports and fitness products in the world, and to offer the best service and consumer experience – and to do it all in a sustainable way. To successfully do that, we focus entirely on our authentic sports brands as they connect and engage with our consumers.

				<h3> How are our products better?</h3>
				<p>Adidas is a step ahead of many other big sportswear brands when it comes to sustainability. We have committed to setting context-based targets, a recent thought process in sustainability that recognises that water impacts are local and prioritises focusing efforts in water-stressed basins. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="dark">
				<p> As part of their Sustainability Strategy, Adidas has established a number of goals aimed at reducing their carbon footprint. We have made a public commitment to reduce our waste production, energy consumption and water use by at least 20% at all our facilities by 2020. </p>

	<p>adidas has its roots in Germany but we are a truly global company. Around the world we employ nearly 57,000 people. Employees from about 100 nations are working at our global HQ in Herzogenaurach, Germany – the ‘World of Sports’. Every year we produce over 900 million sports and sports lifestyle products with independent manufacturing partners worldwide. In 2017 we generated sales of € 21.218 billion. These numbers alone can easily suggest that adidas is quite a large and also multifaceted organization. True. But we keep things simple, lean and fast. And we will use this approach now to give an overview of what our company is all about </p>
